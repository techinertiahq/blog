We were working in a small startup based in powai (<a href="https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/other/has-mumbai-finally-got-its-silicon-valley/articleshow/45891283.cms">silicon valley of mumbai</a>) trying to figure out how to get customer's and what best use our skill's to get exponential growth. He was right, it's a insightful book with view's of Peter Thiel on what it really meant to start something new with real life example's. During this time one of my relative asked me the question "Why should you read in first place?". Wouldn't it effect our original thought process and divert efforts in things that worked for other people in different setting. Its a valid point which got me to think whether that would really be the case. </p><p>I enjoyed reading Zero to One and followed my intuition to read more books. To figure out whether reading really helps or not, i had to read a few many first. What i realized during this process was i liked reading books which i found inspiring or have mentions of the problem which i am struggling with or share failure experiences of others who have tried before. So reading books sure had a positive impact on the way i thought about things. It inspired me to go one step further, showed how others have found way when it looked like the end of road and learning from experience of others can help broaden the scope of my views. </p><p>Summing up the answer to "<strong>Why should you read?</strong>"</p><ul><li>Inspires you to keep on doing the things you love. </li><li>Broadens your scope of looking at a problem.</li><li>Presents guidelines for solving a problem, on which we can start and develop a process that works for us.</li><li>Teaches us about the topics we have not dealt with.</li><li>Sharing this knowledge with colleagues and relatives helps them too.</li></ul><p>Although i would agree its not that reading books is the only way to learn and grow. It helps if you really like doing it. Finally what really matters is getting it done. One thing i have definitely learnt from reading is it wont happen on its own, you have to keep the book down and get to work. </p><p>Doing is by the best way to learn and nothing can substitute that. Although it certainly helps to take out some time and learn something new from others. May be it inspires a solution to problem you are already facing or might face. </p><p>Finally, the must read list of books : -</p><ol><li>Zero to One - Peter Thiel</li><li>Power Of Habit - Charles Duhigg</li><li>Deliverying Happyness - Tony Hsieh</li><li>The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho</li><li>Scaling Up Excellence - Hayagreeva Rao and Robert I.
