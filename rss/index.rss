The power of git comes from the ease of branching and merging the code base allowing for flexibility in development. Although a lot of teams fail to create and follow a branching model which best suits the style of team. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="//res-1.cloudinary.com/techinertia-com/image/upload/q_auto/v1/techinertia/2019/04/Git-Survey---Github-2018_o.png" class="kg-image" alt="What No One Tells You About Git Branching"><figcaption><a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018">A survey from Stack Overflow Insights - 2018</a></figcaption></figure><p>Each team is unique and has to take the time to iterate over which branching model suits them the best. In most cases a single model does not completely fit a teams dynamics, teams will then need to combine certain models and device standards to cater to business-specific needs. </p><p>Choosing the right branching model for your team is a crucial decision directly affecting the developer time in collaborating and not developing new code. A suitable model will save several hours or even days and a wrong choice of model will waste valuable developer time in merging code for several hours. </p><h2 id="few-branching-models">Few Branching Models </h2><ul><li>Long Running Branches</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="//res-1.cloudinary.com/techinertia-com/image/upload/q_auto/v1/techinertia/2019/04/longrunningbranches-5.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="What No One Tells You About Git Branching"></figure><ul><li>Feature Branches</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="//res-5.cloudinary.com/techinertia-com/image/upload/q_auto/v1/techinertia/2019/04/featurebranches-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="What No One Tells You About Git Branching"></figure><ul><li>Gitflow</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="//res-4.cloudinary.com/techinertia-com/image/upload/q_auto/v1/techinertia/2019/04/gitflow-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="What No One Tells You About Git Branching"></figure><ul><li>Environment Branches</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="//res-4.cloudinary.com/techinertia-com/image/upload/q_auto/v1/techinertia/2019/04/environmentbranches.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="What No One Tells You About Git Branching"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>And many more  :</p>

<li>Developer Proficiency</li>
<li>Environments - Dev, Staging, Beta, Production etc</li>
<li>How To Handle New Features</li>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2><p>When you are starting on a new project or shifting your codebase to git consider this guideline to shape your workflow.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li>develop branch is the latest branch</li>
<li>every new functionality needs to be done with a new feature branch</li>
<li>a simple feature branch naming scheme like featurename_date serves well for developers to work on.</li>
<li>commit message need to be sufficient understand what's included in the code. A very detailed commit message usually never get read in history.</li>
<li>keep the Readme file updated.</li>
<li>once a stable Dev code base is achieved developer can then push the code to staging.</li>
<li>staging level bugs need to be fixed with feature branches into Dev then staging.</li>
<li>after a few testing cycles, the stable staging code is pushed to production branch which could be master.</li>
<li>tag all production release with a version of the software for trackability</li>
<li>hot fixes from production can be handled based on criticality. Blocker issues could be fixed on production and then propagated down. Others need to follow the same cycle like a feature.</li>
<li>maintain environment specific properties in branches. Fresh checked out code should be directly deployable. This allows you to automate the deployment using CI cd.</li>
<li>If pull request control is a must for your team do at the staging level. Develop an environment should be handled by the developer for speed.</li>

We were working in a small startup based in powai (<a href="https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/other/has-mumbai-finally-got-its-silicon-valley/articleshow/45891283.cms">silicon valley of mumbai</a>) trying to figure out how to get customer's and what best use our skill's to get exponential growth. He was right, it's a insightful book with view's of Peter Thiel on what it really meant to start something new with real life example's. During this time one of my relative asked me the question "Why should you read in first place?". Wouldn't it effect our original thought process and divert efforts in things that worked for other people in different setting. Its a valid point which got me to think whether that would really be the case. </p><p>I enjoyed reading Zero to One and followed my intuition to read more books. To figure out whether reading really helps or not, i had to read a few many first. What i realized during this process was i liked reading books which i found inspiring or have mentions of the problem which i am struggling with or share failure experiences of others who have tried before. So reading books sure had a positive impact on the way i thought about things. It inspired me to go one step further, showed how others have found way when it looked like the end of road and learning from experience of others can help broaden the scope of my views. </p><p>Summing up the answer to "<strong>Why should you read?</strong>"</p><ul><li>Inspires you to keep on doing the things you love. </li><li>Broadens your scope of looking at a problem.</li><li>Presents guidelines for solving a problem, on which we can start and develop a process that works for us.</li><li>Teaches us about the topics we have not dealt with.</li><li>Sharing this knowledge with colleagues and relatives helps them too.</li></ul><p>Although i would agree its not that reading books is the only way to learn and grow. It helps if you really like doing it. Finally what really matters is getting it done. One thing i have definitely learnt from reading is it wont happen on its own, you have to keep the book down and get to work. </p><p>Doing is by the best way to learn and nothing can substitute that. Although it certainly helps to take out some time and learn something new from others. May be it inspires a solution to problem you are already facing or might face. </p><p>Finally, the must read list of books : -</p><ol><li>Zero to One - Peter Thiel</li><li>Power Of Habit - Charles Duhigg</li><li>Deliverying Happyness - Tony Hsieh</li><li>The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho</li><li>Scaling Up Excellence - Hayagreeva Rao and Robert I.
